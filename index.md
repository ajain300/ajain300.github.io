## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech working at the intersection of machine learning, materials informatics, and simulation. My research focuses on building data-driven systems that can reason about molecular & physical structures, predict properties, and guide scientific discovery through automation.

## Current Work

### Autonomous Labs for Materials Design  
Designing closed-loop platforms that combine ML models with automated synthesis and characterization to accelerate the discovery and optimization of polymer materials.

### Generative Modeling for Complex Polymer Structures  
Developing deep generative models—including diffusion and flow-matching architectures—to predict realistic atomic-level polymer conformations under structural and stochastic constraints.

### Physics-Informed Techniques for Materials Informatics  
Incorporating physical priors, graph representations, and empirical equations into ML pipelines to improve model interpretability and scientific reliability.
